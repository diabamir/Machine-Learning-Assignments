# Machine Learning Assignments - Solutions Repository

## Overview

This repository contains the solutions for a series of machine learning assignments. Each assignment covers various topics in machine learning, such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation. The solutions have been implemented using Python, with extensive use of libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.
